#🎬  Netflix-Trends-Analysis Project 


## 📌 Overview  
This project analyzes the **Netflix dataset (`netflix_titles.csv`)** using Python libraries **Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib**.  
The main focus is on **data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization** to explore content distribution, ratings, duration, and release trends.

## 🛠️ Steps Performed  

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed missing values from key columns like *type, director, cast, country, date_added, release_year, rating, duration, listed_in, description*.  
   - Exported a cleaned dataset into Excel (`Cleaned Netflix Dataset.xlsx`).  

2. **Data Visualization**  
   - 📊 **Movies vs. Shows Comparison** → Bar Chart  
   - 🥧 **Content Rating Distribution** → Pie Chart  
   - 📈 **Movies Duration** → Histogram  
   - 🔵 **Release Years vs. Number of Shows** → Scatterplot  
   - 🌍 **Top 10 Countries with Most Releases** → Horizontal Bar Chart  
   - 📉 **Movies vs. Shows Per Year** → Line Chart  
   - 📊 **Movies vs. Shows Subplots** → Subplot Chart for side-by-side comparison  

3. **Data Export**  
   - Cleaned and processed dataset saved as: `Cleaned Netflix Dataset.xlsx`
